Real Quick for anyone trying this out while I am at a stopping point... You can fire lasers with 1, 2, and 3 and move using the arrow keys.
Firing the small laser (2) will slowly deplete your laser energy.
Firing the large laser (3) will deplete your laser energy more quickly.
Known bugs... enemies that have no life left will still bounce off the left side of the screen.
Will address this issue in the responsive iteration of development when I also adapt this for different device types.
Credit for all current artwork and the base tutorial goes to Frank Dvorak, an excellent teacher in game design.  His tutorials sparked this style of game development for me.
